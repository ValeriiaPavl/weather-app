# Weather-app
Hyperskill project: a web page that shows weather for chosen cities (Flask)

A project, that I made along the tutorial from Jet Brains Academy (hyperskill.org). Python code and html are mine, skin and css are from Jet Brains Academy.

While doing the project I got acquainted with Flask, SQLAlchemy with SQLite, requests and Jinja template language operations.

The main idea is to show weather for chosen cities on the browser page with skins corresponding the time of the day. The weather is requested from weather API ( I used weatherapi.com).
